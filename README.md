# Dad

## A Discord Bot

Dad is a Discord Bot for sending jokes and puns to the channel.

## Cloning

If you haven't already, make a Discord account. Go to discordapp.com/developers/applications and create a new application. Make a bot user by navigating the sidebar menu. Once you've done this, open a new command prompt/powershell window. Use this command:
```$ git clone github.com/cyliim/dadbot.git```
Open the folder and go to `config.json`. Where it says "TOKENHERE", copy and paste your token from the application you made earlier. Navigate to the directory and use `node index.js`. Your Dad is up and running!
